Given a Pattern and a dictionary, print out all the strings that match the pattern. 
where a character in the pattern is mapped uniquely to a character in the dictionary ( this is what i was given first). 

e.g 1. ("abc" , <"cdf", "too", "hgfdt" ,"paa">) -> output = "cdf" 
2. ("acc" , <"cdf", "too", "hgfdt" ,"paa">) -> output = "too", "paa"
